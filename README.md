# Unhandled Exceptions in MongoDB Async Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error when interacting with MongoDB using Node.js's `mongodb` driver: forgetting to handle exceptions properly within asynchronous operations.

The `bug.js` file shows code that connects to a MongoDB database and performs some unspecified operation. It uses a `try...finally` block to guarantee the database client is closed even if errors occur.  However, it fails to explicitly handle any exceptions that might be thrown during database operations. This can lead to silent failures, making debugging much harder. 

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that explicitly handles potential exceptions using a `catch` block, providing more robust error handling and clearer debugging information.
